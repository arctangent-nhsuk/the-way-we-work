## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is The Way We Work?

This document and its appendices set out our vision for how software developers should go about their work within NHSUK. 

It provides a view of our policy arranged in such a way that the Development & Test Leadership Team ("the leadership team") can act independently in a fair and consistent way while bringing about the policy objectives.

While we'd encourage all developers and related professionals to read this document, the best way to get started is to read the appropriate Quick Guide in the appendices to see what this policy means for you specifically.

### 1.2 Why have we created The Way We Work?

Developers have told us that in order to do their best work they need a clearer explanation of their roles and more support from the leadership team. This document is our attempt to meet those needs.

The leadership team are also mindful of improvement targets set by senior managers including the Director of Product Delivery, the Head of Software Engineering, and NHSUK's Head of Delivery. This document explains how we will empower our developers to bring about the required improvements.

### 1.3 How we designed The Way We Work

We believe in:

- Growth: Everyone has the potential to improve
- Autonomy: People work best when they control how they work
- Mastery: People work best when they are always learning
- Purpose: People work best when they choose what to work on within their areas of responsibility
- Support: People work best when they are supported by their colleagues
- Structure: Progress is best made within an iterative and incremental system

Therefore:

- We will focus on future growth, not on past performance
- We will ensure individuals choose what to work on and how to do that work
- We will ensure individuals have the time to learn new things
- We will ensure individuals understand their role and responsibilities
- We will ensure individuals at all levels receive the support they need
- We will expand the current quarterly objective setting cycle to accommodate the above

### 1.4. How we will measure our success

The Way We Work will be judged a success if it helps NHSUK software developers rapidly deliver value to users whilst improving the technical quality of our products.

The leadership team will be held accountable for those business outcomes, which will be measured at a team level (i.e. for each delivery team). The Way We Work is not intended to be a way to assess the performance of individuals.

The leadership team has decided to measure their success in 3 broad categories:

- Software Engineering Quality Dashboard
- Individual Contribution
- Team Participation

**Software Engineering Quality Dashboard**

The dashboard contains a number of technical measures for each of our products and we have been instructed to improve those scores.

The leadership team will monitor progress towards improving our scores, which will be achieved by developers completing objectives as part of their 20% time.

We will measure this for each delivery team as a whole rather than at an individual level.

**Individual Contribution**

Users are happy when value is delivered continuously because they can enjoy that value immediately.

Developers are happy when value is delivered continuously because it makes work more effective, efficient and sustainable.

The leadership team will monitor how often teams are able to contribute code which is deployed to production.

We will measure this for each delivery team as a whole rather than at an individual level.

**Team Participation**

We do our best work when we work together and when we help each other to improve.

The leadership team will monitor activity on Jira tickets.

We will measure this for each delivery team as a whole rather than at an individual level.

## 2. Roles Explained

### 2.1 Summary

All software developers have a shared purpose: to use software engineering best practices to support rapid and safe delivery of high-quality software.

However, we must match the right people to the right tasks to make sure all the work gets done and to make sure work remains challenging and enjoyable for all our developers.

Certain work areas require more knowledge, skills, and experience than others. Therefore, the seniority of a software developer determines which types of work they should focus on. 

As a general rule, as a developer progresses through their career we expect their general focus to shift from individual work to a whole-team approach.

### 2.2 Responsibility Matrix

The responsibility matrix below shows pay bands across the top and areas of responsibility down the side. The new responsibilities acquired at each pay band are therefore set out in a columnar fashion.

|ROLE TITLE|Developer (bands 6 & 7)|Senior Developer (band 8a)|Principal Engineer (band 8b)|Development & Test Manager (band 8c)|
|---| :--------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | -------------- |
| **FOCUS** | **SELF** | **SINGLE TEAM** | **MULTIPLE TEAMS** | **ALL TEAMS** |
|**CODE**| Feature Development | System Design, Feature Development, and Documentation | Engineering Quality Framework |                |
|**LEADERSHIP and AUTONOMY**| 20% Time | SDMT Operational Planning | Strategy Implementation and Lean Improvement Projects | Vision and Strategy |
|**GROWING THE TEAM**| Pairing | Mentoring | Coaching | Delegating |
|**DUTY OF CARE**| Buddying | Line Management | Line Management | Line Management |
|**FINANCE**|  |  | Payments to Contractors | Overall Budget |

Developers should focus on activities in their own column rather than activities in preceeding columns.

## 3. Responsibilities Explained

This section lists the key activities and associated best practices required within each of the responsibility areas.

We believe that if developers do these things, and if they try to always improve how they do them, then surely excellent outcomes will follow. 

### 3.1 Code

#### 3.1.1 Feature Development

Feature Development refers to all the activities involved in creating new features, enhancing existing features, or fixing bugs. These activities include sprint planning, writing code, managing Jira tickets, reviewing code, and carrying out retrospectives.

The reason we do Feature Development is to deliver value to our users. These users most frequently are members of the public but can also include our colleagues (e.g. through improvements to admin functionality).

As well as delivering value directly by working on user-facing features, we also deliver value indirectly by making improvements to the code and infrastructure in order to comply with non-functional requirements (NFRs) set out in the Engineering Quality Framework.

Feature Development work is carried out within a delivery team.

**Sprint Planning**

Sprint Planning is a planning activity undertaken by a delivery team before each new sprint begins. 

The reason we do Sprint Planning is to help the developers in the team select an achievable amount of work for the upcoming sprint, taking into account the relative value which will be delivered to users and the information available to developers (so that we only work on tickets which are "ready").

Best practices:

- attend sprint planning at the beginning of each sprint
- help to select which stories will be in the next sprint
- agree to select only those tickets which are sufficiently elaborated
- take into account your other responsibilities when deciding how many tickets to select
- agree only to an amount of work that you can comfortably complete (and deploy) in the next sprint
- ensure the solution is delivered incrementally, with a deployment each sprint

**Writing Code**

Writing Code is the act of transforming requirements into instructions a computer can follow in order to deliver value to users. This activity will typically involve a great deal of problem solving, both in determining what those instructions should be and also in how those instructions can be issued in a way that guarantees a high degree of success (e.g. through making code testable and the system observable).

Best practices:

- write code which is deployed to production at least once per sprint
- collaborate with fellow developers to select appropriate tickets from the sprint backlog
- comply with coding standards while creating new code
- ensure you write unit tests, and collaborate with testers to ensure they can write tests too

**Managing Jira Tickets**

We use Jira to manage the flow of work within delivery teams. It is important for all members of a team to manage their own Jira tickets in order for the delivery manager and other team members to have an accurate view of the team's progress.

Best practices:

- ensure Jira tickets assigned to you are kept up to date
- write notes on Jira tickets to record progress or document blockers
- write notes on Jira tickets to record mentoring/pairing and what was learned
- change the status of Jira tickets promptly to help keep your team informed

**Code Review**

Code Review is a quality assurance activity undertaken prior to new code being merged into the code repository's main branch.

The reasons we review code are to ensure that new code correctly interprets and solves requirements, to ensure new code complies with agreed standards, to ensure that at least one other person apart from the author understands the new code (i.e. the code reviewer), and to provide an opportunity for dialogue leading to teaching, learning, and continuing professional development of both the author and the reviewer.

Best practices:

- review the code of other developers in your team
- ensure your team is following a code review checklist
- review other people's code before writing your own
- invest enough time to provide a thorough review
- ensure code complies with our coding standards
- ensure you understand the new code
- use the code review as an opportunity to provide constructive advice and teaching

**Retrospectives**

Retrospectives are an opportunity to consolidate learning and to agree improvement activities before each new sprint begins. They help to ensure that a delivery team can adapt in order to maximise the flow of value to users.

Best practices:

- attend a retrospective at the end of each sprint
- before attending a retrospective, reflect on what went well in the last sprint and what went less well
- express your opinions honestly in the retrospective whilst respecting other people's feelings
- ensure that Jira tickets are created to address issues
- ensure improvement tickets are brought into the following sprint so that improvements can be realised

#### 3.1.2 System Design and Documentation

System Design and Documentation are important activities taking a whole-system approach to ensuring value can be delivered to users continuously.

We focus on ensuring systems are well designed - and remain so through refactoring - so that it is always as easy as possible to do additional feature development work without accruing technical debt.

We focus on ensuring the system is well documented so that new team members can be brought quickly up to speed where required, thus ensuring the team can be scaled up if completion of the product backlog is required sooner than is currently projected.

System Design and Documentation is carried out within a delivery team.

Best practices:

- lead the design of the solution
- ensure the system remains well-documented at all times
- check the system against the criteria in the Engineering Quality Framework
- ensure the system conforms to approved NHSUK architecture patterns
- ensure all architecture decisions are documented in a standard location
- ensure code and tests are sufficiently documented
- ensure documentation allows new team members to contribute to the project
- ensure each project has a README.md file containing (at least) links to complete documentation
- maintain coding standards documentation

#### 3.1.3 Engineering Quality Framework

The Engineering Quality Framework (EQF) is a set of agreed standards and best practices put in place across the Product Development directorate by our Head of Engineering. Compliance with these standards and best practices is measured and reported in the Engineering Quality Dashboard (EQD).

It is a priority for NHSUK software delivery leadership to deliver improvements to our EQD scores. This requires identifying and leading effective and efficient cross-product programmes of development activity that can be undertaken alongside feature development work.

This work will be carried out by the leadership team in collaboration with SDMT.

- maintain and develop technical expertise in the EQF areas
- design and deliver technical prototypes or experiments to inform decisions and future development
- collaborate with the leadership team to decide the future technical direction of NHSUK
- ensure scores in the EQF areas are tracked for each of our products
- maintain up-to-date technical expertise through regular and routine learning
- collaborate with other Principal Engineers to share knowledge and discuss improvement ideas
- provide expert technical advice to SDMT and individual Senior Developers are required

## 4. Quarterly objective setting cycle

TODO

This is going to be very similar to the system Jacob already put in place. We can reuse some of the diagrams used to explain that system (in particular the goal-setting and 1-2-1 reviews) because they remain identical.

Need to produce a calendar showing key activities

Monthly-ish granularity i.e. to the level of when devs should be updating the corporate system with news about completed objectives.

- on a quarterly basis, with your line manager, agree 3 ambitious personal objectives each with about 4 SMART key results
- ensure that one of your personal objectives is related to an agreed training activity
- enter your objectives and key results on the corporate PDR system


### 4.1 Summary

TODO

### 4.2 The Quarterly Cycle

TODO

### 4.3 Alignment with HR 

TODO

Create a "conversation check-in" once per fortnight (i.e. to capture what was discussed in the 1-2-1)

HR requires a "performance check-in" at the beginning and end of the year.

Reasoning behind fortnightly updates to corporate system: The majority of staff in NHSD do not work in two-week iterations like NHSUK software developers do. To those other staff, a monthly meeting cycle makes sense (and is a big improvement over the previous annual meeting cycle). Within NHSUK it makes more sense to meet fortnightly as we have described in TWWW. The corporate system can be updated with relevant information every two weeks.
