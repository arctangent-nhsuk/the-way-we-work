## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is The Way We Work?

This document and its appendices set out our vision for how software developers should go about their work within NHSUK. 

It provides a view of our policy arranged in such a way that the Development & Test Leadership Team ("the leadership team") can act independently in a fair and consistent way while bringing about the policy objectives.

While we'd encourage all developers and related professionals to read this document, the best way to get started is to read the appropriate Quick Guide in the appendices to see what this policy means for you specifically.

### 1.2 Why have we created The Way We Work?

Developers have told us that in order to do their best work they need a clearer explanation of their roles and more support from the leadership team. This document is our attempt to meet those needs.

The leadership team are also mindful of improvement targets set by senior managers including the Director of Product Delivery, the Head of Software Engineering, and NHSUK's Head of Delivery. This document explains how we will empower our developers to bring about the required improvements.

### 1.3 How we designed The Way We Work

We believe in:

- Growth: Everyone has the potential to improve
- Autonomy: People work best when they control how they work
- Mastery: People work best when they are always learning
- Purpose: People work best when they choose what to work on
- Support: People work best when they are supported by their colleagues
- Structure: Progress is best made within an iterative and incremental system

Therefore:

- We will focus on future growth, not on past performance
- We will ensure individuals choose what to work on and how to do that work
- We will ensure individuals have the time to learn new things
- We will ensure individuals understand their role and responsibilities
- We will ensure individuals at all levels receive the support they need
- We will expand the current quarterly objective setting cycle to accommodate the above

### 1.4. How we will measure our success

The Way We Work will be judged a success if it helps NHSUK software developers rapidly deliver value to users whilst improving the technical quality of our products.

The leadership team will be held accountable for those business outcomes. The Way We Work is not intended to be a way to assess the performance of individuals.

The leadership team has decided to measure their success in 3 broad categories:

- Software Engineering Quality Dashboard
- Individual Contribution
- Team Participation

**Software Engineering Quality Dashboard**

The dashboard contains a number of technical measures for each of our products and we have been instructed to improve those scores.

The leadership team will monitor progress towards improving our scores, which will be achieved by developers completing objectives as part of their 20% time.

**Individual Contribution**

Users are happy when value is delivered continuously because they can enjoy that value immediately.

Developers are happy when value is delivered continuously because it makes work more effective, efficient and sustainable.

The leadership team will monitor how often developers are able to contribute code which is deployed to production.

**Team Participation**

We do our best work when we work together and when we help each other to improve.

The leadership team will monitor activity on Jira tickets.

## 2. Roles Explained

### 2.1 Summary

All software developers have a shared purpose: to use software engineering best practices to support rapid and safe delivery of high-quality software.

However, we must match the right people to the right tasks to make sure all the work gets done and to make sure work remains challenging and enjoyable for all our developers.

Certain work areas require more knowledge, skills, and experience than others. Therefore, the seniority of a software developer determines which types of work they should focus on. 

As a general rule, as a developer progresses through their career we expect their general focus to shift from individual work to a whole-team approach.

### 2.2 Responsibility Matrix

The responsibility matrix below shows pay bands across the top and areas of responsibility down the side. The new responsibilities acquired at each pay band are therefore set out in a columnar fashion.

|ROLE TITLE|Developer (bands 6 & 7)|Senior Developer (band 8a)|Principal Engineer (band 8b)|Development & Test Manager (band 8c)|
|---| :--------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | -------------- |
| **FOCUS** | **SELF** | **SINGLE TEAM** | **MULTIPLE TEAMS** | **ALL TEAMS** |
|**CODE**| Feature Development | System Design, Feature Development, and Documentation | Engineering Quality Framework |                |
|**LEADERSHIP and AUTONOMY**| 20% Time | SDMT Operational Planning | Strategy Implementation and Lean Improvement Projects | Vision and Strategy |
|**GROWING THE TEAM**| Pairing | Mentoring | Coaching | Delegating |
|**DUTY OF CARE**| Buddying | Line Management | Line Management | Line Management |
|**FINANCE**|  |  | Payments to Contractors | Overall Budget |

Developers should focus on activities in their own column rather than activities in preceeding columns.

## 3. Responsibilities Explained

This section lists the key activities and associated best practices required within each of the responsibility areas.

We believe that if developers do these things, and if they try to always improve how they do them, then surely excellent outcomes will follow. 

### 3.1 Code

**Writing Code**

- write code which is deployed to production at least once per sprint
- collaborate with fellow developers to select appropriate tickets from the sprint backlog
- comply with coding standards while creating new code

## 4. Quarterly objective setting cycle

TODO

This is going to be very similar to the system Jacob already put in place. We can reuse some of the diagrams used to explain that system (in particular the goal-setting and 1-2-1 reviews) because they remain identical.

Need to produce a calendar showing key activities

Monthly-ish granularity i.e. to the level of when devs should be updating the corporate system with news about completed objectives.

- on a quarterly basis, with your line manager, agree 3 ambitious personal objectives each with about 4 SMART key results
- ensure that one of your personal objectives is related to an agreed training activity
- enter your objectives and key results on the corporate PDR system


### 4.1 Summary

TODO

### 4.2 The Quarterly Cycle

TODO

### 4.3 Alignment with HR 

TODO

Create a "conversation check-in" once per fortnight (i.e. to capture what was discussed in the 1-2-1)

HR requires a "performance check-in" at the beginning and end of the year.
